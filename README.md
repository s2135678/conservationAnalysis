# Conservation Analysis 

This Python program downloads user-specified genomic data from NCBI, performs multiple sequence alignment (Clustal-Omega), and conducts various conservation analyses. These include pattern and motif scanning, and predicting and plotting transmembrane segaments and the hydropathy. This program was designed and built as part of the MSc Bioinformatics course (Bioinformatics Programming module) at University of Edinburgh (2020).
